The goal of this assignment is to design a sale that maximizes incremental revenue. We don’t expect you to get it right on the first try - we don’t hold ourselves to such a high standard! Instead, we’ll ask you to design one or more offers, select a target group, and prescribe a test protocol that can be used to evaluate the results.
We’ve provided sample data for a group of users who installed during the first quarter of 2016. The data includes:
· User data, including user ID and install date
· Session history, including date and session number
· Purchase history, including date and amount
· Spending history, including date, currency, and amount
